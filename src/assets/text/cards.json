If none are found but a genome assembly is present, Brownotate will compute a new annotation for the genome. In cases where only sequencing data has been found, Brownotate will start with the assembly before proceeding to the protein annotation.", "Stop thinking, click on Run and get automatically the proteins of your species !"],
